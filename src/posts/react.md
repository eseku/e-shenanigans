Now i don't know why i didn't move to react for the larger portion of my life since i started web dev.
Okay well i guess it was because of how even jquery was giving me headaches and i had concluded that 
javascript was 
a confusing slash boring ass language.
Truth be told it is, with weird concepts like callbacks etc.

I did an internship at a firm who uses Microsoft in everything from their IIS Servers to ASP dot net / dot net core
to typescript. First task was to make a CRUD app for a shop's inventory. It took weeks cos i though i knew how to write c#
but turns out all i knew was rubbish and i had to relearn the whole language. I didn't want to do that so i copied someone's 
project which was to make a Cars Rental Application

Luckily my project did not involve any entity relationships so i just copied the guys work and made the necessary changes yeah.
A 10 out of 10. Even used a text file to escape that db context bullshit. Now we were supposed to move to dot net and implement the same thing. Bro. WHAT WAS THE REASON. Once again i just looked at Kwame's (who seemed to grasp everything so fast) work and copied ahaha. 


Shamelessly tho but with the help of materialize css these niggas thought i was such a pro. They even asked some of the other interns to learn from me. It was at that point i knew i didnt know anything lmao. So the idea of taking javascript seriously began at that point around May when i had a few more weeks to do the internship and i was going to take web dev as a course in school for the next semester.
I started with some node and express and some REST architectural patterns and i guessed i was to a good start
